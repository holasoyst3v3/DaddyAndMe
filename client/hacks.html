        <h1>SLEEP HACKS</h1>
        <p>With sleep often times most babies require a few things:
          <li>-Something to sooth themselve i.e. Pacifiers, blanky, stuffed animal</li>
          <li>-Warm milk</li>
          <li>-Lots of patience and love</li>
          <br>SIMPLE ENOUGH!
          <br><br>Months 0-2 are crutial for transitioning babies from sleeping in your room vs. their own. Consider buying a camera(not necessarily the baby camera that cost upwards of $200) that connects over the internet and has a mobile app you can use on your smartphone/tablet. There are some inexpensive yet reputable security cameras under $70 that will give you mobile app access, talk and listen function, and recording their shinnannigans when they wake up.
          <br><br>Most doctors will tell you to wake the baby up to feed them. Unless they are sick or sickly babies, try to refrain from that after month two. This will trigger a response that "hungry or not, I will wake up every x amount of hours to be fed" I am speaking from experience and the reccomendations from our pediatrician.
          <br><br>YOU WILL GET CLOSE TO YOUR OLD SLEEP PATTERNS BY MONTH TWO!!
          <br><br>IT WILL BE ROUGH FOR A FEW WEEKS YOU CAN DO DADS!!
          <br><br>**Please take what I say with a grain of salt. Just know, both of my children are healty, sleeping +10hrs since month two and reaching their "milestones" ahead of others.

          <h1>FEED HACKS</h1>
          <p>Feeding time can be fun, and also messy! Make the best out of it!
            <br>Once babies reach around month 6, it's a great time to introduce self feeding, and never underestimate the power of your child being able to ask ask for food, water and milk.
            <br><br>Repetition, repetition!!
            <br><br>Constantly show them for example their bottle of milk and simply annunciate milk, this crosses into teaching how to pronounce words, and expand their vocabluary/communication skills. But we'll cover that in the communication hacks section later.
            <br><br>Give momma a break!!
            <br><br>When it comes to night feedings, fellas, give that woman some rest! If she is able to pump, take over the night feedings. That queen, carried your seed for almost a year!! Say thanks by giving her the rest she deserves.
            <br><br>Have fun!
            <br><br>There is no, and never will be, shame in making airplane noises or car noises while attempting to shove some food in your baby's mouth. I promise they will get a kick out of it. Spread some food or snacks on their high-chair, and watch them work. Using their tiny little sausage fingers to pinch and grab tiny foods, or handle big peices, using their might "kung-fu" grip! Look at that, teaching how to self feed, AND tuning fine motor skills!
            <br><br>WAY TO GO DAD!!
            <br><br>

            <h1>DIAPER HACKS</h1>
            <p>The same way you have your candy of choice stashed around the house, do the same with diapers and wipes. I cannot begin to tell you how annoying it can be to have to make your way back to their room to change them. Especially when they have a blow-out.
              <br><br>YUCK!!
              <br><br>Wherever you are chaning your chunk full of joy, be sure to have something to entertain them with. Theres nothing more frustrating when it comes to changing a diaper, than having to wrestle your dirty baby to change them. It can literally be ANYTHING. Reach in your pocket, hand them that chapstick and watch their focus change from whats happening to this thing they're fiddling with.
              <br><br>SMOOTH WIPING DADDY-O!!
